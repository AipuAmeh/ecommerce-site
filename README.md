## Description

This weeks challenge required us to create tables for our database and insert them through the connection package Sequelize. We also had to create routes using the CRUD operation Get, Post, Put, and Delete. 

## Installation

Express and Sequelize are need to be installed for this application to work.
## Usage

To install the routes, first connect to the database by adding your passowrd and username to a new .env file using the example file. Then enter "node seeds" into the integrated terminal to seed the pre-populated data. Finally, type "nodemon run watch" into the terminal to start the server and test the routes!
