# ECommerce-Site

## Description

This weeks challenge required us to create tables for our database and insert them using the connection package Sequelize. We also had to create routes that tested the CRUD operations: Get, Post, Put, and Delete.

Express, Sequelize, dotENV, and MySQL2 need to be installed for this application to run.
## Usage

To install the routes, first connect to the database by adding your passowrd and username to a new .env file using the example file. Then enter "node seeds" into the integrated terminal to seed the pre-populated data. Finally, type "nodemon run watch" into the terminal to start the server and test the routes through Insomnia!
